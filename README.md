# Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance

Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance
This program implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in a system with multiple processes and resources. It determines whether the system is in a safe state and, if so, provides the safe sequence for process execution.

**Introduction**
The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It ensures that processes request resources in a safe sequence to avoid deadlock situations. This program takes input data regarding resource allocation, maximum resource needs, and available resources and determines if the system is in a safe state. If so, it provides the safe sequence for process execution.

**Usage**
This program can be used to analyze a system's resource allocation and determine if it's in a safe state to prevent deadlocks. It requires input data specifying the allocation and maximum resource needs of processes, as well as the currently available resources.

**Input Data**
The input data consists of two main matrices:

Allocation Matrix: Specifies the resources currently allocated to each process.
Maximum Matrix: Specifies the maximum resources that each process may request.
Additionally, the program requires a vector specifying the currently available resources.

**Output**
If the system is in a safe state, the program outputs the safe sequence for process execution. If not, it indicates that the system is in an unsafe state.

**Compilation and Execution**
To compile the program, use a C++ compiler such as g++. Run the following command:

**g++ -o bankers bankers_algorithm.cpp**

To execute the program, run the compiled executable:

**./bankers**

**Example:**
Suppose we have a system with five processes (P0 to P4) and three resource types (A, B, C). We provide the allocation, maximum, and available resources data to the program. Upon execution, it determines if the system is in a safe state and outputs the safe sequence if applicable.
